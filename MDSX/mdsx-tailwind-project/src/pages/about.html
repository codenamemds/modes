                My name is Mars Delavonta Silver - I am an artist, designer, cultural curator, and tech professional born and bred on the South Side of Chicago, IL. Throughout the majority of my professional career, I have served on four non-profit boards and previously directed Programs and Engagement at the Rebuild Foundation and Theaster Gates Studio â€“ where I produced thousands of cultural programs and events, dozens of exhibitions, and managed an ecosystem of cultural institutions that housed archives and collections on which I have successfully led the digitization and restoration process.
                Currently, I am honing in on advancing my tech skills in various domains because I ultimately want to build an ecosystem of cultural institutions on the South Side of Chicago, IL, and from previous experience, I learned that technology will be essential to this vision.
